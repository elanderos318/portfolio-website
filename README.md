# Portfolio Website

This is the code for my portfolio website that you can find at https://elanderos318.github.io/portfolio-website/

A website designed from the ground-up displaying my experience, skills, and accomplishments. This is the first project in which the CSS is completely, originally engineered. Also, this project was bootstrapped using 'create-react-app', and React is the essential library at work here, with Components/Elements allowing for a simple methodology for displaying and writing code. Here, you may access my résumé and other contact information such as my email, LinkedIn, and Github.

Please let me know what you think of my website by using the contact links on the site.
